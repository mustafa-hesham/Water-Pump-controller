# Water-Pump-controller
This device was made to control a water pump depending on the pressure inside pipes which is obtained by a MPU6050 gyroscope.
The MPU6050 gyroscope was placed inside a pressure guage and attached to its pointer and calibrated to match the coordination given by the gyroscope to the pressure value on the guage.
The device also has a menu to navigate through different options like setting the desired pressure low and high limits, calibrate the pressure.
The device has the ability to detect if water pressure is increasing or not after outage, though it needed further improvement.
